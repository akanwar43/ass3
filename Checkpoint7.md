The events start off with regular announcements, and an IP range that has been announced as belonging to YOUTUBE, first recognized on 2-21 <br>
At 2-24 at noon, an IP range origininally claimed by YOUTUBE is being claimed by PAKISTAN-TELECOM several times in succession throughout the day <br>
YOUTUBE makes a new announcement with the same ip but with prefix /25. Shortly after, the same ip with range /25 is being claimed by PAKISTAN-TELECON <br>
IPs with the same range but different prefix are claimed alternatively by both PAKISTAN-TELECON and YOUTUBE throughout 2-24 <br>
<br> <br> <br>

In reality the messages we see reflect the events of Pakistan's attempt to censor Youtube. Under govt. order, Pakistan Telecon announces that it owns the ip range owned by Youtube <br>
A Hong Kong hub seeing these announcements does not reject them, which means that Pakistan is now recieving the vast majority of global traffic intended for Youtube.<br>
Youtube fights by switching the ip range it is posting under, then Pakistan reclaims it, repeat util over.
